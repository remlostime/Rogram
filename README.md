This app leverage [Composable Arch](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture) library to fulfill Redux based app. 
It also use [Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher) for Network Image. We can also use built-in `AsyncImage`. But Kingfisher provides better image features like placeholder, cache, network performance.
